# Bank-Marketing-Campaign-Analysis-and-Modeling
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and modeling project on a bank marketing campaign dataset. 
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and modeling project on a bank marketing campaign dataset. The dataset includes 4,000 customer interactions during a phone-based marketing campaign, with 15 input features (7 numerical and 8 categorical) and a binary output feature indicating product subscription (yes/no).

Key highlights of the project include:

Data Summarization: Detailed overview of the dataset's features, including statistical insights on customer demographics and interactions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth exploration of relationships between features and subscription outcomes, with visualizations revealing key trends and correlations.
Model Evaluation: Implementation and comparison of three classification models—Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayes—using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score as performance metrics. The Random Forest model, achieving the highest recall, is identified as the best performer for the task.
Model Implementation: Deployment of the Random Forest classifier to predict customer subscription outcomes, with detailed steps for preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Business Recommendations: Data-driven insights and recommendations for optimizing future marketing campaigns, focusing on key features such as call duration, job category, and customer demographics.
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to real-world business challenges, providing actionable insights to enhance marketing strategies.
